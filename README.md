# Subject: SLE 712
# Project title: Assigment 3 

## Aim

This project is a combination of Git hub and Rstudio where Git hub is the version control.

aim of part-1:

 * develop skills in problem solving and R coding.
 
aim part-2:  

* Download and unzip files.
* Perform simple manipulations and analyses with sequence data.
* Use a provided function to incorporate point mutations into a sequence.
* Use provided functions to perform a BLAST search and interpret results.
* Creating functions to perform complicated issues related to randomised mutated blast searches.


## Motivation

To practice R studio and Git hub collaberation.

## Contents

gene_expression.tsv-data set for RNA sequence of two samples of interest
growth_data.csv-contains measurements for tree circumference growing at two sites, control site and treatment site which were planted 20 years ago.
E.Coli gene sequence database.
sample.fa-multifasta file of 200 sequences of E.coli
A sequence of interest known as Groupseq.
Set of functions(myblastn,myblastn_tab, mutator)

## Installation

Rstudio version 1.2.1335 and R
R version 3.6.3
